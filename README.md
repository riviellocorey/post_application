# Welcome my name is Corey!

Hi! I had a blast building this application. Some special features I've included were, **Auto Complete**, **Bootstrap**, and **Lazy Loading**. I look forward to going over the code Monday. The installation and usage details are below.


# Installation / Usage

    git clone https://github.com/riviellocorey/post_application.git // Installation
    cd post_application
    
    
    npm install // Install Dependencies
    npm start // Start application without developer environments
    npm run dev // Start application with nodemon & dev environments
    npm run tests // Run tests for frontend & backend
